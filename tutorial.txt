TODO - explain how game works

The game consists of 3 rounds each with a series of duels. 
Each duel has one attacking player and one defending player.
Every alternating beat the attacker attacks by stepping on one or two of the front pads,
every other beat the defender has to step on the corresponding back pads to defend.
Steps are only registered as valid inputs if on the beat (listen to the metronome)
If at any point either player makes a mistake the duel ends and attacker and defender switch.
If a player wins two more duels than the other player, they win the match and a new match begins, best 2 out of 3.


Possible results of duel:
-Attacker misses beat or doesn't attack: 'Fumble', defender becomes attacker, pauses then attacker can initiate next duel
-Defender misses beat or doesn't block attack: 'Hit', Attacker wins duel, defender becomes attacker, pauses then attacker can initiate next duel
-Defender steps on corresponding attacking pads at same time as attacker: 'Parry', Defender becomes attacker immediately and must immediately do attack, no pause, duel continues with changed position


At the end of the game you can do a finisher. Whoever won can hit up to 12 pads with any timing building up a creshendo.
There are a few special combos of pad presses that play a super secret special finisher audio.
