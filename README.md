Project: Feet Fighter: Deadly Dancing - Reloaded

Authors: Ciaran McDonald-Jensen, Camila Restrepo, Kidane Gabay, Torben Hunnerup

Description: This is our hackathon project. We made a fast paced cardio action dance fighting game using two DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) pads as controllers for the game. There is no digital screen for the game, just music to help you step to the beat and verbal instructions to lead you through the game stages.
tutorial.txt can be seen with instructions on how the game functions

How to run the game: Plug in two DDR pads to your laptop and run main.py





Organization of project:
main.py runs the project and has the main control loop, it calls functions from other files and takes and sends input. config.py holds configurations for the game. In theory more game modes can be devoloped for this, the game mode would be set in config.py. Based on the game mode main.py will call fight.py functions that do almost all the logic.
